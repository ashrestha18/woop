  For viewers who wish to browse and engage with YouTube without the fear of being exposed to 
spoilers for shows or movies, Spoil Block is designed to allow users to enjoy all the features and conveniences of YouTube, while avoiding videos that contain spoilers for movies or shows they are watching or are planning on watching. 
  On our website, users will be able to maintain a list of shows or movies they wish to avoid spoilers for, using IMDB's extensive media database. Users can choose to create a list of movies and shows to avoid shows and movies for or import their IMDB watchlist. Our Google Chrome browser extension will then use our algorithm to blur titles and/or thumbnails of videos that contain spoilers for the user's chosen shows or movies. 
  Unlike browser extensions that claim to block YouTube spoilers, our application will provide users with the opportunity to customize their level 
of spoiler blockage, from blurring thumbnails to redacting video titles. Spoil Block also blocks 
videos relating only to movies and shows selected by the user, whereas competitors only 
provide universal changes to all YouTube videos.
