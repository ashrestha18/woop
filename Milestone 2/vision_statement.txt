For viewers who wish to browse and engage with YouTube without the fear of being exposed to 
spoilers for shows or movies they are currently watching or plan on watching. Spoil Block is 
designed to allow users to enjoy all the features and conveniences of YouTubeâ€™s extensive video 
library but with additional features provided from our application that enables them to select 
movies or shows they wish to avoid spoilers for. Unlike browser extensions that claim to block 
YouTube spoilers, our application will provide users with the opportunity to customize their level 
of spoiler blockage, from blurring thumbnails to redacting video titles. Spoil Block also blocks 
videos relating only to movies and shows selected by the user, whereas competitors only 
provide universal changes to all YouTube videos. Our product will implement a complex 
algorithm that determines whether or not a video contains spoilers.
