Project Idea:

 A website that is built on ASP.NET Core MVC and deployed on Azure. The website offers the user to enter a hiking location they want. The project will provide annual statistical weather data about the location using 'openweathermap' api. The logic of the program will provide the user with suggested gear for the hike using product suggesting api. The other alteration of the project will show open hiking routes near the entered data.
