My idea is to create an app that allows a user to enter in any shows, movies, or games they would like to avoid spoilers for. The app would then, using the YouTube api,
filter out any videos from the user's YouTube recommendations or search results that contain any keywords or phrases related to the selected shows, games, and movies. 
This app would use a ASP.NET Core MVC style front-end web app and an algorithm designed to filter out certain content based on keywords and phrases related to the show.
Possibly using a search engine or something similar to find popular topics or articles/videos related to the media.
