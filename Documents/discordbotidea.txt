A discord bot uses the discord API to make common tasts on discord more efficient.  It can also auto-moderate discord servers and respond to messages and interact with users and the host computer.  The projecct would be write a bot that has some features not commonly seen, like utilizing cloud storage or providing basic web interactivity such as scraping websites.  Most popular bots have a host of common features which I'd like to implement as well.  The website deployed to Azure would be a download link with the ability to log in and perhaps see a log of what your bot has done.
